# Weekly Plan

## Week 16

- Calculation
  + Torque
  + MPU-6050 returned value processing

- Sttat machine
- Re-design some body part.
- Get PCB and assemble all parts 
- Initiate the report.

## Week 15

- ~~Prototyping some body part for experiment.~~
- ~~Enlisting full electrical components with their price tag.~~
- ~~Buy the electrical components~~
- Initial calculation
  + Torque
  + ~~Power consumption~~
  + MPU-6050 returned value processing  
  + Body balancing factor (Applied mechanics lul)
- Re-design some body part.
- ~~PCB order (JLCPCB maybe)~~
