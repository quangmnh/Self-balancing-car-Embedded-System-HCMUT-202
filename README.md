# Abstract

We are making a Self-balancing robot taking inspiration from Wouter Klop's project

https://gitlab.com/kloppertje/balancingrobot

# Weekly Plan

## Week 20

- Calculate:
  + Torque
  + MPU-6050 returned value processing  
  + Body balancing factor (Applied mechanics lul)
- State machine
- Re-design some body part (da battery case, may need to ask Mr.Vỹ)..
- Print :
  + Battery Case (for next week when we receive the battery pack)
- Source code:
  + Clean up Mr. Klop's source code
  + Modularize them for easier report effort
- Hopefully make it run for da first time


## Week 19

- Calculation
  + Torque
  + MPU-6050 returned value processing  
  + Body balancing factor (Applied mechanics lul)
  + ~~Battery consumpstion and motor performance~~
- State machine 
- Re-design some body part (da battery case, may need to ask Mr.Vỹ).
- ~~Get PCB and assemble all parts ~~
- Print :
  + ~~Frame~~
  + ~~Wheel~~
  + Battery Case (for next week when we receive the battery pack)

## Week 16

- Calculation
  + Torque
  + MPU-6050 returned value processing  
  + Body balancing factor (Applied mechanics lul)
- State machine
- Re-design some body part.
- Get PCB and assemble all parts 
- Initiate the report.

## Week 15

- ~~Prototyping some body part for experiment.~~
- ~~Enlisting full electrical components with their price tag.~~
- ~~Buy the electrical components~~
- Initial calculation
  + Torque
  + ~~Power consumption~~
  + MPU-6050 returned value processing  
  + Body balancing factor (Applied mechanics lul)
- Re-design some body part.
- ~~PCB order (JLCPCB maybe)~~
